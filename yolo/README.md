There you'll only find some workaround/improvement for the functions i used in my learning and test session

improvement :

    fix of the reference bug since i was giving a pointer once i free the original i lost it on the array of structure as i use pointer and i freed it

    better tracking of the items byte size

    Creating a push function with margin to reduce the amount of realloc used
