To compile it simply use gcc main.c

There you'll only find some workaround/improvement for the functions i used in my learning and test session


first improvement :
    fix of the reference bug since i was giving a pointer once i free the original i lost it on the array of structure as i use pointer and i freed it


second improvement :
      better tracking of the items byte size
